Small Python mini projects created while learning

This repository contains small Python projects that I am building while learning Python.
Each project helps me understand logic and problem solving better.

## Projects (in progress)
- Calculator (CLI)
- Student marks system
- To-do list

I will keep adding more projects as I learn.
